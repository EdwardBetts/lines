Requirements:
- matplotlib
- numpy


Usage:

- left mouse button: add a point
- right mouse button: remove a point
- middle mouse button: update stepco file / print coordinates to screen


To create a new background, any file can be loaded. On middle mouse button, current coordinates will be printed to stdout.
./lines.py data.xy


For background correction, a stepco file can be loaded with '-x':
./lines.py stepscan.dat -x stepco.inp

When satisfied with the new background, it can update the stepco file by using the middle mouse button (don't forget!).
You're old stepco.inp file will be backed up to stepco.inp~


Multiple data files can be loaded quickly:
./lines.py data1.xy data2.xy data3.xy

By default the data files are staggered, but they can be forced to overlap by specifying -n/--nomove
